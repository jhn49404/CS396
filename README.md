CS396
=====

A project for a class.

How to Checkout with Git
===

(because we're noobs at this)

Fork on github.

$ git init

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/CS396.git

$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/jhn49404/CS396.git

(These will be the same for you Joe.)

$ git pull origin master

How to Edit with Git
===

$ git commit -a -m "MESSAGE"

$ git push github master

Notes
===

Commit updates only your local repository. Push updates github.

Make sure to pull from github occasionally to keep all of our code in check.

Sublime text has a nifty shortcut (with the Git plugin installed) to commit: Ctrl+shift+p, "quick commit" => message.
